h1. Thinking Sphinx with Raspell

This library adds Aspell/Raspell support to "Thinking Sphinx":http://ts.freelancing-gods.com.

h2. Installation

You'll need "the Aspell library":http://www.aspell.net (easily compiled by source, or installed via MacPorts). Don't forget to install the English library as well - there's instructions for both in Evan Weaver's "Raspell README":http://github.com/fauna/raspell.

Once that's set up, grab the gem from "GemCutter":http://gemcutter.org:

<pre><code>sudo gem install thinking-sphinx-raspell \
  --source http://gemcutter.org</code></pre>

You'll want to add the gem to your @config/environment.rb@ file (assuming you're working on a Rails application):

<pre><code>config.gem('thinking-sphinx-raspell',
  :lib     => 'thinking_sphinx/raspell',
  :source  => 'http://gemcutter.org',
  :version => '>= 1.0.0'
)</code></pre>

Or, if you wish to do a manual require yourself:

<pre><code>require 'thinking_sphinx/raspell'</code></pre>

h2. Usage

By default, Thinking Sphinx will not overwrite your search query, but you can view suggestions:

<pre><code>@articles = Article.search 'pnacakes'
@articles.suggestion? #=> true
@articles.suggestion  #=> 'pancakes'</code></pre>

You can also choose to redo the search using the provided suggestion:

<pre><code>@articles.redo_with_suggestion
@articles.each do |article|
  # ...
end</code></pre>

h2. Configuration

You can customise the following settings - either in your @config/environment.rb@ file, or perhaps in an initializer. Example syntax below highlights the current defaults.

<pre><code>config = ThinkingSphinx::Configuration.instance
config.raspell.dictionary             = 'en'
config.raspell.suggestion_mode        = :normal
config.raspell.options['ignore-case'] = true</code></pre>

You can look at the available options using the following two collections:

<pre><code>config = ThinkingSphinx::Configuration.instance
config.raspell.dictionaries     #=> ['en', 'en_GB', 'en_US', ... ]
config.raspell.suggestion_modes #=> [:ultra, :fast, :normal, :badspellers]</code></pre>

h2. Limitations

* Only checks normal query strings, not field-specific queries via the @:conditions@ hash.

Patches are very much welcome - I would like to address this last remaining limitation.
